                    PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES
                    AND CLAIMS WITH MY PENSION GUIDE AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.
                </p>

                <p>
                    YOU AND MY PENSION GUIDE AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN
                    ANY WAY TO THESE TERMS OR THE MY PENSION GUIDE SERVICES SHALL BE FINALLY DECIDED BY BINDING
                    ARBITRATION UNDER THE RULES OF THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION GOVERNING CONSUMER DISPUTES.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Arbitration uses a single, neutral arbitrator to decide a dispute (instead of a judge or jury);
                    arbitration allows for more limited discovery than in a court case; and the arbitration process and
                    result is subject to very limited review by courts. In an arbitration you have the right, at your
                    expense, to be represented by an attorney of your choosing. Arbitrators can award the same damages
                    and relief under these Terms that a court can award under these Terms. You and My Pension Guide
                    agree that any in-person arbitral hearing would occur in the United States in the same county and
                    state as your billing address. My Pension Guide further agrees that your filing fee for an
                    arbitration will be capped at the amount set by the American Arbitration Association. You agree
                    that, by agreeing to these Terms, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and
                    enforcement of this provision, and that you and My Pension Guide are each waiving the right to a
                    trial by jury and/or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive
                    termination of these Terms and the termination of your use of the My Pension Guide Services.
                    Further, unless both you and My Pension Guide agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not join or
                    consolidate more than one person’s claims with your claims and may not otherwise preside over any
                    form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be
                    unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. The
                    arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking
                    relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual
                    claim.

                <p>
                    If any term, clause or provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, then that term,
                    clause or provision will be severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or
                    enforceability of any remaining part of that term, clause or provision, or any other term, clause or
                    provision of these Terms.

                    The My Pension Guide Services are hosted in the United States of America. If you are located outside
                    of the United States of America and you contact us, please be advised that any information you
                    provide to us will be transferred to the United States of America and that by submitting
                    information, you explicitly authorize such transfer. These Terms constitute the entire agreement
                    between you and My Pension Guide relating to your access to and use of the My Pension Guide
                    Services. These Terms, and any rights granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you
                    without the prior written consent of My Pension Guide. No waiver of any provision of these Terms
                    will constitute a waiver of such provision in any prior, concurrent or subsequent circumstance, and
                    My Pension Guide's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a
                    waiver of such right or provision. Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended
                    solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights
                    upon any other person or entity.
