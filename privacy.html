                    <li><span><strong>Web Beacons: “Web Beacons”</strong>(a.k.a. clear GIFs or pixel tags) are tiny
                            graphic image files embedded in a web page or email that may be used to collect information
                            about the use of our My Pension Adviser Services, the websites of selected advertisers and
                            the emails, special promotions or newsletters that we send. The information collected by Web

                            using selected publishers’ websites or opening emails, and for what purpose, and also allows
                            us to enhance our interest-based advertising (discussed further below).</span></li>

                    <li><span><strong>Web Service Analytics:</strong> We may use third-party analytics services in

                            Services. We use the information collected from these services to help make the My Pension
                            Adviser
                            Services easier to use and as otherwise set forth in Section 5 (How We Use Your
                            Information). These analytics services generally do not collect personal information unless
                            you voluntarily provide it and generally do not track your browsing habits across web
                            services that do not use their services.</span></li>

                            identifiers help My Pension Adviser learn more about our users’ demographics and internet
                            behaviors in order to personalize and improve the Site. Mobile device identifiers are data
                            stored on mobile devices that may track mobile device and data and activities occurring on
                            and through it, as well as the applications installed on it. Mobile device identifiers
                            enable collection of personal information (such as media access control, address and
                            location) and Traffic Data.</span></li>

                <p>
                    We may use a type of advertising commonly known as interest-based or online behavioral advertising.
                    This means that some of our partners use Tracking Tools to collect information about a user’s online
                    activities to display My Pension Adviser ads to the user based on the user’s interests
                    (<strong>“Behavioral Advertising”</strong>). Such partners may include third-party service
                    providers, advertisers, advertising networks or platforms, traffic measurement service providers,
                    marketing analytics service providers, and other third party service providers (collectively,
                    <strong>“Advertising Service Providers”</strong>). Other Tracking Tools used by our partners may
                    collect information when you use the Site, such as IP address, mobile device ID, operating system,
                    browser, web page interactions, geographic location and demographic information, such as gender and
                    age range. These Tracking Tools help My Pension Adviser learn more about our users’ demographics and
                    internet behaviors.

                <p>
                    Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) incorporate a “Do Not
                    Track” (DNT) or similar feature that signals to web services that a visitor does not want to have
                    their online activity and behavior tracked. If a web service operator elects to respond to a
                    particular DNT signal, the web service operator may refrain from collecting certain personal
                    information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and there is currently no
                    industry consensus as to what constitutes a DNT signal. For these reasons, many web service
                    operators, including My Pension Adviser, do not proactively respond to DNT signals. For more

                <p>
                    Please note that we will need to verify your identity before we are able to process any of the

                    If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (<strong>“EEA”</strong>), when we process your
                    personal data, we will only do so in the following situations:

                <ul>
                    <li><span>We need to use your personal data to perform our responsibilities under our agreement with

                            Services.</span></li>

                    If your personal data is subject to the GDPR or UK GDPR, we will transfer personal data from the EEA
                    to a location outside the EEA only when there has been a documented adequacy determination, or where
                    we have confirmed adequate privacy protections. If we transfer personal data to a third party acting
                    as our agent, we will also obligate the third party to have adequate privacy protections in place.

                    If your personal data is subject to PIPEDA, we will transfer personal data from Canada to locations
